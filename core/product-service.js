        "Description": "Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Chair and Stool (1929), originally created to furnish his German Pavilion at the International Exhibition in Barcelona, have come to epitomize modern design. Mies van der Rohe designed the chair to serve as seating for the king and queen of Spain, while the stool was intended to accommodate their attendants. Still produced to his original specifications, this Barcelona is of quality fit for royalty. The cushions – welting and buttons included – come from a single Spinneybeck® or Edelman Leather cowhide and are supported by cowhide belting straps, dyed to match the color of the chair. To create the deep, precise tufting, individual panels of leather are cut, hand welted and hand tufted. The chromed-steel frame is hand buffed to mirror-like perfection. The Barcelona Chair was honored with the Museum of Modern Art Award in 1977. The Barcelona Chair is a registered trademark of Knoll®, Inc., manufactured by Knoll; according to the original and exacting specifications of the designer. Made in U.S.A.\n\nThe leading German avant-garde architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was the third and last Bauhaus director. Appointed by the founding director of the school, Walter Gropius, he replaced the previous director Hannes Meyer, who was dismissed for political reasons in1930. Both the school and the city of Dessau had hoped that Mies van der Rohe’s authority would have a calming influence on the school’s radicalised student body. However, because of the balance of power in Dessau, which was dominated by the National Socialists, even Mies van der Rohe was unable to maintain the school’s location. He attempted to continue the school’s teaching activities in Berlin until its enforced closure in 1932.\n\n\nhttp://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/ludwig-mies-van-der-rohe",

A blend of viscose and wool, this rug has a subtle shine and plush texture that feels great under your feet, especially when you shed your shoes and socks. And unlike rugs with bold patterns that overpower the room, the Broken Stripe is more of a non-pattern aesthetic. It is unique and visually rich, but it doesn’t steal the show from your furniture or artwork. (If only all the things in our lives were so well behaved.) The Broken Stripe Rug’s manufacturer is a member of Rugmark, which ensures that the Rug is made in a socially responsible manner.

        "Description": "I have always been inspired by the language of turntables and entertainment units from the 1960s,\" says Singaporean designer Nathan Yong. Which is a remarkable statement when you learn that Yong grew up in a wooden hut by the sea, where he and his brother made their own toys and \"waited for low tides so we could pick up treasures from the shore.\" Growing up with the beach as entertainment, Yong has developed into a resourceful designer, whose work captivated us with its quiet elegance. At Salone del Mobile, the annual furniture fair in Milan, Yong showed his Line Media Console, inspired by \"the fluid streamlined forms of 1960s stereo components.\" We liked the aesthetic so much that we asked Yong to expand the collection. He responded with one of the best-looking bars we've ever seen. The Line Bar (2010) has two drawers with leather pulls, three open cubbies, a storage rack for stemware and a storage rack for 12 bottles. (The bottle storage racks are removable.) Made in Malaysia. \n\nNathan Yong graduated from Temasek Polytechnic with a diploma in Industrial Design in 1991. He began his career not as a designer, but as a buyer as well as engaging in product development for various companies in Singapore.Through these jobs, he travelled to various countries including India, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia to source for quality manufacturers and craftsmen to develop and manufacture furniture and home accessories. Through this exposure, he learnt various production techniques and crafts.\n\nIn 1999, Nathan started his first retail store called Air Division,, selling his own creations made by Asian craftsman. Air Division rapidly grew and claimed commercial success in both Singapore as well as the overseas market. Nathan subsequently sold Air Division and pursued a Master degree from the University of New South Wales, Australia, which he subsequently graduated with distinction in Master of Design. For two consecutive years (in 2006 & 2007), Nathan won the prestigious Red Dot Concept Design Award with his conceptual designs of a mass production coffin and a portable room heater.Subsequently in 2008, Nathan received the prestigious Singapore President’s Design Award; Designer of the Year, the highest honor accorded to designers from all creative disciplines in Singapore.His work is inspired by simple visual memories from everyday life, but pared down with the lightness of restraints. Instead of superfluous details, he captures the poetry of products through rigorous research and engineering, creating fresh styles and functions that fit effortlessly into the user’s life.\n\nIn the 2011 International King size supplement, INTERNI for Salone del Mobile,Nathan Yong was selected as the most promising Young Designers on the international scene. He says “I like my design to evoke a sense of wonder and bring a smile to those who observe and use them, conveying the idea that lies behind their creation. Like the Pebble Tables, based on the image of stones, concave and convex, formed and shaped by the water current of rivers over time. Most of my projects start with an operation of stripping, due to the need to make the function, the material, the method and the result as comprehensible as possible, retaining its authenticity of its objective.” Explaining his works are like “silent engineering”, he says “It is what allows the form to express itself, based on technical considerations, not just as a graphic scheme.”\n\nhttp://www.nathanyongdesign.com/site/about",

        "Description": "Most people are familiar with Danish designer Verner Panton for his S-shaped chair and op-art environments, but his Fun Lamps (1964) are equally iconoclastic. One of the most sought-after modern lighting designs at auction today, the Fun Lamps give modernism a decorative dimension without being cute – think of them as functional jewelry for interiors. The cascading design is composed of hand-cut mother of pearl discs, which make wonderful musical sounds when stirred by a breeze. These lamps have an ethereal presence, with light shining through the discs to produce a warm, opulent glow. Bulbs (not included): incandescent E26. Made in Denmark.\n\n• Each lamp is stamped with Panton’s signature and comes with a certificate of authenticity.\n• UL listed and suitable for commercial use.\n• Ships flat to avoid tangling; assembly required.\n\nVerner Panton was an inspirational and colourful personality. A unique person with a special sense of colours, shapes, light function and room. \n\nOver the course of his career Verner Panton (1926-1998) introduced a series of modern lamps with personalities unlike any of his Scandinavian contemporaries. \n\nWith a remarkable faith in the unlimited possibilities of the form, he worked successfully to create a new set of theories about how lighting should work and how it should influence its surrounding. \n\nVerner Panton in his own words:\n\"The main purpose of my work is to provoke people into using their imagination. Most people spend their lives living in dreary, grey-beige conformity, mortally afraid of using colours. By experimenting with lighting, colours, textiles and furniture and utilizing the latest technologies, I try to show new ways, to encourage people to use their fantasy imagination and make their surroundings more exciting\".\n\nhttp://www.verpan.com/verner+panton/verner+panton",

This table has a straightforward aesthetic that will suit almost any environment. While the Cross Extension’s strong, unadorned geometry creates a distinctly up-to-date piece, Hilton softens the outline with tapered legs that flare from the base like the supports of traditional pedestal tables. \n\nAdaptable to changing dining needs, the tabletop expands with a simple pull, allowing insertion of up to two leaves for three possible table sizes: 78.75\", 97.5\" and 116\". After guests depart, the leaves store in a felt-lined compartment on the table’s underside. The Cross Extension Table received the 2006 Elle Decoration Best in Furniture Award. Walnut table made in Malaysia; others made in Lithuania.\n\nMatthew Hilton (born 1957) is a British furniture designer of modern furniture.Hilton attended Portsmouth College of Art and then Kingston Polytechnic graduating in 1979. After graduation he was an industrial designer and model maker until 1984. In 1991, he designed the \"Balzac Armchair\"[1] for SCP Limited, a company started by Sheridan Coakley in 1984 and now based in Shoreditch, London. Hilton was Habitat's top designer,[2] and his furniture is held in the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Geffrye Museum, London, and the Manchester City Art Gallery.

        "Description": "German silversmith Christian Dell was a metalworking teacher at the Bauhaus from 1922–25. Collaborating with modernist luminaries László Moholy-Nagy and Marianne Brandt, Dell helped shape the Bauhaus approach to industrial lighting. He started designing lighting for various companies in 1926, including Gebrüder Kaiser & Co., the one that produced the first lamp in the Kaiser-idell Collection (1931). With the first part of the name being for the factory that produced it, the latter is an amalgam of Dell and idee, the German word for “idea.” Brought back into production by Fritz Hansen in 2011, the collection is crafted to the designer’s original specifications, including his worldwide-patented swivel joint for shade adjustability – revolutionary in 1931. Bulb (not included): 4\" or shorter LED; E26 base; 25W max. UL Listed. Made in Denmark. \n\n\nChristian Dell was one of the designers who played a formative role in shaping the Bauhaus style. Before going to the Bauhaus in Weimer in 1922, Christian Dell served an exacting apprenticeship as a silversmith, spending the years 1907-12 at the Schleissner & Söhne silver factory in Hanau as an apprentice while studying at the \"Königlich Preußischen Zeichenakademie\" in Hanau. In 1913 Christian Dell worked as a silversmith in Dresden before going to the \"Kunstgewerbeschule\" in Weimar, where he met Henry van de Velde. \nAfter serving in the armed forces, Christian Dell was a journeyman in 1918-20 and then went to work in Munich as a master silversmith for Hestermann & Ernst. In 1920 Christian Dell went to Berlin to work for the silversmith Emil Lettré. \n\nThen Dell returned to Hanau and reenrolled at the \"Preußische Zeichenakademie\". From 1922 until 1925 Christian Dell was a works master in the metalworking workshop at the \"Bauhaus\" in Weimar, where he collaborated closely with László Moholy-Nagy and produced numerous designs for office and workplace metal light fittings. \n\nFrom 1926 until he was dismissed from his post by the National Socialists, Christian Dell was head of the metalworking workshop at the \"Frankfurter Kunstschule\". There he designed a great deal of lighting, including the \"Rondella-Polo\" (1926-27) table lamp and the \"Idell\" range, which was mass produced mainly by Kaiser & Co., Rondella, and, later, also by Bünte & Remmler.\n\nhttp://www.dell-christian.com/",

In creating the Visu Chair (2012) – which is named after visu, the Finnish word for “precision” – “the task was to create a personal interpretation of the ever-relevant plywood chair,” he says. What he created are actually two different chairs: an unupholstered version with wire base and an upholstered version with wood base. Both are suitable for use in a home, restaurant or office. The unupholstered version with wire base stacks up to 14 high. Made in Lithuania. \n\nMIKA TOLVANEN is part of the Finnish Rehti Design group. After graduating from the Royal College of Art with a Master in design in 2001, Mika established his own design office in Helsinki. He has since worked with some of the world’s top designers and manufacturers. \n\nMIKA TOLVANEN ON HIS DESIGN PHILOSOPHY\nThe objective is not only to design products but rather look for occasions that need design. What really defines objects is how we use them not what they appear to be. Design should not be the one that requires attention by being special.\n\nMIKA TOLVANEN ON NEW NORDIC DESIGN\nThe way of doing design is always very personal for each designer. But the way we dwell up here has penetrated our lives and the way we design. Nordic design has always been here and there have been no gaps between periods. Only means of manufacturing have developed making new design more exciting.\n\nhttp://www.mikatolvanen.com",

        "Description": "The inspiration for the Byam Rug (2011) came from \"the seemingly effortless play of form and proportion exemplified by the great architecture of Louis Kahn,\" says British designer Christopher Farr, \"particularly in the design of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.\" Farr was educated at the Slade School in England, studied textiles in villages in Peru and Turkey, and taught fine art at the Byam Shaw Art School in London (thus the name of the rug). As a rug designer, he approaches the floor as the fifth wall, blending geometric sophistication with ancient rug weaving tech¬niques to create abstract canvases for the floor (which is why Byam is available in one size and one colorway – like a work of art.) The Byam Rug is hand spun and hand tufted of fine wool and manually dyed in small batches to create rich tonal nuances in the strands. Over time, the Byam Rug will become even more beautiful as the wool's natural lanolin emerges and invigorates the surface, creating enhanced luster. Christopher Farr is a member of Care & Fair, an initiative against illegal child labor in carpet production. Made in India.\n\nEstablished in 1988, Christopher Farr has been at the spearhead of contemporary rug design for over twenty five years. Together with his business partner Matthew Bourne, they were the catalyst that revolutionised contemporary rug design.With backgrounds that are firmly rooted in antique Oriental carpets and textiles, Farr and Bourne share a passionate knowledge of contemporary art and design that informs the work that is produced to this day. Furthermore Farr trained at the Slade School of art In London and has allied this to an intimate understanding of the medium of weaving.In 1991, a collaboration with Royal College of Art for an exhibition entitled ‘Brave New Rugs’ became a breakthrough event in the world of design and was the year that the company purchased its last antique rug. From then on the focus has been exclusively on producing contemporary rugs.\n\nhttp://christopherfarr.com/history",

And unlike rugs with bold patterns that overpower the room, the Broken Stripe is more of a non-pattern aesthetic.

        "Description": "For more than two decades, Bruno Rainaldi has been influencing the design scene in Milan. Whether designing furniture, bringing iconic works back into production or teaching students at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts, where he is a professor. When he designed his Sapien Bookcase (2003), he created a unique solution for those with a lot of books and little space to store them. By holding texts horizontally in a vertical stack, the tall Sapien can accommodate up to 70 small and large books in a very compact footprint. (The shorter bookcase will hold up to 50 books.) The removable shelves are a mere 2mm thick but each one can hold approximately five books, or an impressive 5.5 lbs. The tall Sapien has 14 shelves, the short has 10. When fully loaded, the bookcase virtually disappears behind the books. All-metal construction and a heavy, weighted base ensure the design’s strength and stability. Simple assembly required. Made in Italy. \n\nBruno Rainaldi was formed on the field, starting at a young age to work with interior design comunication. \n\nWith irony he described himself as a “street designer” and his style as “chaotically rigorous”. In Milan he directs the first High-tech at Corso di Porta Ticinese. He supports Maddalena De Padova in the storic showroom of corso Venezia, later Enrico Baleri as partner of Baleri & Associati, with communication strategies for companies and designstores. \n\nFounds Studio Rari - in which he is the soul and the creative director - and beguins his first collaborations as creative director/designer with several italian design companies as Alivar, MDF, Mussi Italy, Sintesi. Then Terzani, Slamp, Casprini, Annibale Colombo, Bilumen, Davide Medri e Dilmos. Until the recent project Opinion Ciatti, born from the important artistic- and business-partnership with Lapo Ciatti. In the mid-eighties, Bruno Rainaldi meets Flavia Ciatti. From their friendship/comparison the idea of a new company comes to life - CCR - aimed at developing furniture and accessories for the home, not only for the kitchen. The brand CCR gives birth to important pieces of industrial design. In 2006, Lapo Ciatti, who represents the third generation, enters in the company with the family’s entrepreneurial instinct and with training in industrial design. New comparisons and new opinions. Opinion Ciatti is born of which Bruno Rainaldi is president, partner and artistic director. \n\nWith a deep market knowledge, a great passion for arts and a precios talent for transverse associations matured over the years, Bruno Rainaldi alloy definitly his professionality in the design world. In 2002, together with Marta Giardini, he opens Entratalibera, a very special space in Milan where he exposes his own works and a selection of objects. A “laboratory of shapes”, open towards research and experimentation. \n\nBruno Rainaldi designed bookshelves, tables, chairs, sofas, armchairs, beds, accessories and lighning. A universe of intense and iconic objects without consistency in style, rather the real sense of industrial design: to produce the right object for the right use. What holdes them together it is the essentiality of the design, the freedom of use, the compositional versatility.\n\nhttp://www.opinionciatti.com/en/designers/1-bruno-rainaldi",

        "Description": "Award-winning architect Giulio Lazzotti, working in the tradition of classic Italian sculptors and craftsmen, creates objects of striking elegance and sophisticated simplicity. With an eye for fine materials and an architect's concern for straightforward solutions, he has designed the Grissini Bench, a sleek leather and steel piece for sitting or lounging. \n\nNamed after the Grissini breadsticks one finds on many restaurant tables across Italy, the Grissini Bench (2005) is supported by thin chrome-plated steel legs that occupy little volume and lend the seat a light presence no matter the environment, whether it is a modern art gallery, an office or the entryway of a home. The long, svelte seat is topped by a compact but comfortable pad made of double top-stitched, full-grain aniline leather, expertly applied over a single piece of high-resilience foam. The chrome-plated steel frame, although it looks delicate, is durable and strong. The skeleton extends slightly from the bench seat to increase the airy appearance of the piece, and the chrome corners are joined in smooth mitered joints that underscore Lazzotti's concern for even the smallest details. Made in Italy.\n\nThe name of the town, Pietrasanta, where Giulio Lazzotti lives and works, can be alternately translated as Saint Peter or \"holy stone,\" the latter being wholly appropriate for a designer and architect whose work in marble, metal and wood takes on a serene, sculptural presence. Lazzotti was educated at the prestigious University of Florence, where he later returned to teach architecture. Since 1975, Lazzotti has maintained a diverse practice encompassing architecture, interior design, and furniture design, winning such awards as first prize for Design at the Moving Fair of Paris, the Torre Guinigi prize in Lucca for Urban Design for the Historical center of Pietrasanta, the top ten in the International Chair Fair at Udine and most recently, the Good Design prize from the Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization.\n\nFollowing in the tradition of classic Italian sculptors and craftsman, Lazzotti's furniture is produced with an artisan's eye for material nuance, and imbued with modernist simplicity. Internationally recognized for his work with stone, Lazzotti has organized symposia on the material and taught courses like \"Design in Marble\" at the Academy of Art in Carrara, Italy (home to the famous white carrara marble quarries). Lazzotti has worked with many international companies, including Castigliani, Iveco, The Conran Shop, Mageia, Up e Up, Bernini, and Smith & Hawken. His work is included in the permanent collections of MoMA in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nhttp://www.dwr.com/category/designers/h-l/giulio-lazzotti.do",

        "Description": "After graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design, Françoise Séjourné began her career by designing clothing for Esprit and shoes for Sam & Libby. It wasn’t long before she was consulting Gap on color trends and starting not one but two successful businesses. This high-energy lifestyle left Séjourné craving one thing: a comfortable place to sit and relax. And that’s when she started the Eazy Bean Company. A luxurious twist on traditional beanbags, the Everest (2010) is really more like a chair, allowing you to sit in an upright or reclining position just by shifting the interior beans. The removable covers are machine washable, even the Tech Suede, an eco-friendly fabric made from 90–100% post-consumer materials. Made in U.S.A.\n\nIt's hard to label Francoise Sejourne. Designer, consultant and entrepreneur, she created anything from shoes and apparel to home furnishings, consulted for fashion greats such as the Gap on trend and color, designed for major fashion houses, and founded two successful businesses. Blue Marlin, a vintage sportswear apparel company co-founded by Sejourne, quickly became a celebrity & international favorite.\n\nShortly after receiving a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design in textile and graphics, Sejourne packed up for the west coast, where designing for fashion houses Esprit and Sam and Libby sent her across the world. The idea of eazy bean occurred after several years of constant travel and the simple desire for a comfortable place to sit. From a mere thought, this concept developed into more than a decade's worth of work.\n\nEazy bean's beautiful sculptured pods evoke feelings of humor, fun, and sheer elegance through a unique use of color and timeless form.Drawing inspiration from her travels, Sejourne brings a global palette of color to her creations: the turquoise of Palau's waters, spice markets of New Delhi, the cherry blossoms of Japan. No matter what she creates - from commercial goods to one of a kind ceramics Sejourne's sophisticated sense of color, simplicity and elegance shows through. \n\nhttp://www.eazybean.com/information.php?info_id=5",

        "Description": "As a theater and dance student at the University of West Virginia, Ted Boerner developed an intuitive sense of the body and the space it occupies – an awareness that now lends his furniture its genial angles and careful proportions. He attended NYU for grad school, and began his career as a set and costume designer. “Propping scenes and imagining the things that characters would surround themselves with made me think about how important furniture is to people,” says the designer. Modern sofas often claim minimalist appeal, but few can also tout the comfort of the Theatre Collection (2001). Designed to accommodate the human body with studied proportions and simple geometry, Theatre’s comfort stems from its form rather than excessive layers of stuffing. With a gently angled backrest, full seat depth and elevated armrests, Boerner’s signature artisan details are evident throughout. A gleaming chromed steel base runs the entire depth of the design, and welted seams lend strength and definition to the upholstery. Ships with legs unattached to save on packing materials. Made in U.S.A.\n\nThe trappings of 20th century Americana are frequently evoked in Ted Boerner's furniture: a Lucite table that resembles a 1940s juice tumbler, a sleek upholstered chaise with the silhouette of a folding pool lounger, a dining table with a Lincoln Log like base. Ted Boerner's childhood summers in rural Wisconsin were filled with midcentury modernist inspiration, much of which stemmed from his grandfather's rustic log cabin. Outfitted with Eames chairs, a hand built modern staircase and a tangible patina of historical vitality, it was a setting steeped in the same simplicity and well-wrought comfort that Boerner has become known for in his furniture designs.\n\nAs a former theatre and dance student at the University of West Virginia, Boerner developed an intuitive sense of the body and the space it occupies – an awareness that would later lend his furniture designs their genial angles and careful proportions. After a shift in academic focus, he earned his BFA in theatre design and continued in the field as a grad student at NYU. Returning to his home turf of Wisconsin, Boerner worked as a production designer for a classical repertory theatre with which he traveled extensively, designing sets and costumes for a myriad of productions.\n\n\"Propping scenes and imagining the things that the character would surround themselves with made me think about how important furniture is to people.\" In the mid-80s Boerner grew weary of his theatre-imposed deracination and settled in San Francisco to work as an interior designer. Yearning for the same freedom to conceive and create furniture that he had as a production designer, Boerner opened his own furniture studio in 1988. Within a year, he was creating exclusive custom furnishings for the Manhattan Hotel in Tokyo and the Governor Hotel in Portland, Oregon. Many of these early designs have become best-sellers in Boerner's current line, exemplifying the designer's unwavering focus on the essential character and craftsmanship of his designs.\n\nIn 1993, Boerner took a space at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair and gained immediate national recognition with four pieces, including his dynamic Crescent Bed. Since then, Ted Boerner, Inc. has had an exponential success with over 45 pieces offered, and a presence in premier designer showrooms and homes throughout the country. Boerner's commercial clients include Nike, Northwest Airlines, Celebrity Cruise Lines, San Francisco's Hotel Rex, New York's Gotham Bar & Grill and Conde Nast's corporate offices.\n\nWith the belief that \"good design should be more accessible,\" Boerner has begun producing furniture in greater numbers after years of one-offs. By working closely with manufacturers and using the finest materials, he retains a level of craftsmanship in his designs not readily found in mass-produced furniture. \"When you own something that is handcrafted, you're reminded of the people and the process behind that piece,\" Boerner states, \"It defeats a throwaway society with a wonderful sense of history.\"\n\nhttp://www.dwr.com/category/designers/a-c/ted-boerner.do",

        "Description": "Through years of working as a full-time designer, running a retail store in Canada and acquiring manufacturing knowledge in Europe, Danish designer Niels Bendtsen found a balance between aesthetics, affordability and quality – all seen in his Crossover Table Collection (2013). Crossover takes its name from the overlapping base design, comprising a solid steel crossbar welded to tubular steel legs. Ingeniously simple and sleek, these tables feature exceptional stability, seamless connections and a pleasing heft that belies their slim appearance. They captivate with details that lend warmth and approachability, from the joinery of their solid ash tabletops down to the finish of their hand-rubbed bronzed feet. Tops have rounded corners and edges for a handsomely finished look, as well as raised lips to help prevent items from falling off. Jigsaw joints and metal plates underneath ensure rigidity and longevity. Each table ships flat; simple assembly required. Made in Canada.\n\n\"Quality is a funny concept. We tend to think of it as being associated with handcraft. But quality is also about your attitude toward design. Craftsmanship is just as much about how you run the machines that are now necessary for economic viability.\"\n\nBorn in Denmark, Niels Bendtsen and his family immigrated to Canada in 1951. In place of a formal design education, Bendtsen trained as an apprentice for his father, who designed and built Scandinavian furniture. Through working with his father, Bendtsen gained valuable skills and a respect for non-industrial, hand-built traditions, but he was also intrigued by new technologies and ways to satisfy increasing demand. Between 1963 and 1972, Bendtsen had his own retail store where he sold his father's furniture, as well as imported Scandinavian designs. He designed small items for the store, but it wasn't until he was in his early thirties that he truly began designing furniture. Dissatisfied with the quality and limited functionality of the furniture he received from his overseas manufacturers, Bendtsen sold his store, moved to Europe and became a full time designer.\n\nIn the 1980s, he moved back to Vancouver, bought back his old store and added a manufacturing component. Using the skills he learned working with European factories, Bendtsen successfully found a balance between affordability, aesthetics and quality. Customers responded, and in the mid-1990s Bendtsen began making his designs available through other retailers, such as Design Within Reach.\n\nAn early Bendtsen design, the Ribbon Chair, is included in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and his work was featured on a Canadian stamp celebrating industrial design. In 2006, Bendtsen was honored with the 2006 British Columbia Creative Achievement Award of Distinction.\n\nhttp://www.dwr.com/category/designers/a-c/niels-bendtsen.do",

He gave it an odd number of legs and positioned the brass castings to radiate out from the center, resulting in a distinctive asymmetrical form that looks different from every angle. “For Helix, I was inspired by the challenge of personalization in the modern world, and the increasing desire that we have to own objects that match our own styles and philosophies – in the way that art does,” explains Hardy. Made by hand, the cast brass base has a natural finish that’s soft and not highly polished; minor pitting and irregularities in the brass are typical of the casting process and are not defects. Thick and durable, the annealed glass tabletop is slowly cooled in a kiln to relieve internal stresses after it’s formed. Leveling glides adjust for uneven floors. Simple assembly required; no tools necessary. Base made in India; tabletop made in U.S.A.\n\nChris Hardy is an American industrial designer based in Atlanta.

Handwoven by a skilled artisan on a traditional punja kilim loom using tie-dyed wool yarns and a sumac weave, this reversible rug offers pops of color without distracting too much from surrounding furniture. Black, blue and yellow hues found in the pattern subtly guide the eye to and fro. Rug pad recommended. Made in India. \n\n* This rug is produced in a GoodWeave-certified factory, which ensures no child had a hand in its making.",
